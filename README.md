# Tetris
In this homework, we will develop a Java Tetris game and test it with Gradle/JUnit. The Tetris code refers to ([Zetcode](https://zetcode.com/javagames/tetris/)). Please modify the code to pass all the tests.

### The assignment
There are several tests in this example. Some of them are failed. Modify the source code files under `src/main/` to make all tests green.

### Run command
`gradle test`

### Notes
JUnit5 is used to test the code. If you use IntelliJ to create the tests, copy your Tetris source codes to `src/main/`, and test code to `src/test`.
